use Pterodactyl\Models\CreditTransaction;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;

DB::transaction(function () {
    $user = User::find(1);
    $amount = 25.00;
    
    $user->credits += $amount;
    $user->save();
    
    CreditTransaction::create([
        'user_id' => $user->id,
        'admin_id' => auth()->id(),
        'amount' => $amount,
        'balance_after' => $user->credits,
        'type' => 'admin_grant',
        'reason' => 'giveaway',
        'description' => 'Promotional credits',
    ]);
});
```

### Send Split Billing Invitation

```php
use Pterodactyl\Models\BillingInvitation;

$invitation = BillingInvitation::create([
    'server_id' => $server->id,
    'inviter_id' => auth()->id(),
    'invitee_email' => 'friend@example.com',
    'share_percentage' => 50.00,
    'message' => "Let's share this Minecraft server!",
]);

// Token and expiry automatically generated
// $invitation->token - Unique 64-char token
// $invitation->expires_at - 7 days from now
```

### Calculate Split Billing Amounts

```php
use Pterodactyl\Models\ServerBillingShare;

$server = Server::find(1);
$totalCost = 19.99;

$shares = ServerBillingShare::where('server_id', $server->id)
    ->where('status', 'active')
    ->get();

foreach ($shares as $share) {
    $userAmount = ($totalCost * $share->share_percentage) / 100;
    echo "{$share->user->username} pays: \${$userAmount}\n";
    // John pays: $9.995
    // Sarah pays: $9.995

    ->whereHas('servers')
    ->get();

foreach ($activeUsers as $user) {

        $user->save();
        
        CreditTransaction::create([

            'admin_id' => 1, // Admin ID
            'amount' => 10.00,

        ]);
    });
}

### Scenario 2: Group of Friends Sharing Minecraft Server

1. **Alex** orders $29.99/month Minecraft server
2. **Alex** invites **Jordan** to split billing
3. **Jordan** accepts invitation
4. Both get full server access

6. **Jordan** pays $14.995/month
7. If **Jordan** leaves, **Alex** returns to paying $29.99/month

### Scenario 3: Refund Processing

User reports server issues, admin issues refund as credits:

```php
$order = Order::find($orderId);
$user = $order->user;

DB::transaction(function () use ($user, $order) {
    $refundAmount = $order->total;
    
    $user->credits += $refundAmount;
    $user->save();
    
    CreditTransaction::create([
        'user_id' => $user->id,
        'admin_id' => auth()->id(),
        'amount' => $refundAmount,
        'balance_after' => $user->credits,
        'type' => 'refund',
        'reason' => 'refund',
        'description' => "Refund for order {$order->order_number} due to technical issues",
